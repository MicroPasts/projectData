The wood was unsuitably soft and has worn badly, there are friction-wear marks in each notch from the string, one end is extensively chipped, and  there are extensive wear areas all around extending 15 cms from the chipped end - perhaps indicative of method of use that this wear is not symmetrically distributed.

Length of stout, metal rod, approx. round-section, approx. equal diameter throughout.
Little corrosion.
Bent into a probably intentional shape; one end a break, the other curled around and split so as partly to enclose the shank.
Use as a handle assumes the angle of the break (at 90*, so as to go away from the spectator) is due only to the breakage and that about 50% of the original survives.
